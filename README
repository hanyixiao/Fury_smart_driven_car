To get started, have a look at L5_Application/main.cpp and the example tasks.

You can change a #define 0 to #define 1 for one example at a time and look
through the code of each example.

The general idea is to interact with the project through terminal commands.

See "ChangeLog" for the changes made to the sample project source code.

LED decode:

LED 3 (Toggle)          - Toggles for every unsucessful queue send of GPS data.
LED 3 (On)              - GPS data is not valid
LED 4 (Toggle)          - Toggles for every unsuccessful read of raw GPS data.
LED 1 and LED 2 (on)    - GPS Data is not on queue
LED 1 and LED 2 (off)   - GPS Data is on queue, and is being computed in 10Hz task

UART usage:
UART 2 is used for GPS receive.
